# chest-Xray-Disease-Detection-CheXpert-Deep-Learning
We have implemented various Artificial Neural Networks to evaluate and compare the performances of different kinds of models such as Single Layer Perceptron’s, Multi-Layer Perceptron’s and Convolutional Neural Networks.


Large datasets have been very beneficial for the deep
learning methods to achieve high levels of performance on various
of medical tasks. CheXpert is a large dataset that contains 224,316
chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. A labeler has been designed
to automatically detect the presence of 14 various diseases. This
dataset has been carefully collected, designed and shared publicly.
We have implemented various Artificial Neural Networks to
evaluate and compare the performances of different kinds of
models such as Single Layer Perceptron’s, Multi-Layer
Perceptron’s and Convolutional Neural Networks. Accurately
detecting the presence of multiple diseases from chest x-rays is a
challenging task even with the usage of state-of-the art models. The
most promising models are ensemble CNN`s.
